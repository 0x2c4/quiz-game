## Console version of a Quic Game.
To start the game, in root folder type:
```bash
python main.py
```

You can update the question list by updating the ```data.py``` file, just 
follow the same structure of the dictionary in it:
```
{"text": "A slug's blood is green.", "answer": "True"}
```
Where the 'text' key will hows the question, and the 'answer' key will
hold the correct answer.

**Enjoy!**
